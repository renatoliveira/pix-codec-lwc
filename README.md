# QR Code App

`qr.min.js` is sourced from https://github.com/paulmillr/qr.

## TODOs:

- [ ] Actually implement the component that generates the QR code on screen.
- [ ] Implement the component logic to allow some degree of customization (transfer values, size, color, etc).
- [ ] Write tests.
- [ ] Write documentation.
